# Even or Odd Number Checker (Java)

This Java program determines whether an integer entered by the user is even or odd.

## Description

The program prompts the user to input an integer. It then checks if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, the program prints that the number is even. Otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.  The program also includes a `try-finally` block to ensure proper resource management (closing the `Scanner`).

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Java code as `EvenOrOdd.java`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:

    ```bash
    javac EvenOrOdd.java
    ```

3.  **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:

    ```bash
    java EvenOrOdd
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter an integer.  Type the integer and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will then display whether the entered number is even or odd.
