# Fibonacci Series Generator (Java)

This Java program generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms entered by the user.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter the desired number of terms for the Fibonacci series. It then calculates and prints the series, starting with 0 and 1. The program includes input validation to ensure the number of terms is at least 1 and uses a `try-finally` block to properly manage the `Scanner` resource.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Java code as `FibonacciSeries.java`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:

    ```bash
    javac FibonacciSeries.java
    ```

3.  **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:

    ```bash
    java FibonacciSeries
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter the number of terms. Type the number and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will then display the Fibonacci series up to the specified number of terms.
